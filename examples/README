Examples of using Effect.

The "github" directory contains a simple application that lets the user input a
GitHub username, and prints out a list of all repositories that that user has
access to.

There are two entrypoints into the example: examples.github.sync_main and
examples.github.twisted_main. sync_main does typical blocking IO, and
twisted_main uses asynchronous IO. Note that the vast majority of the code
doesn't need to care about this difference; the only part that cares about it
is the *_main.py files.

To run them:

    python -m examples.github.sync_main

or

    python -m examples.github.twisted_main
